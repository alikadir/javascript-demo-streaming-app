## Development Proccess
Firstly, I'm a design-obsessive person, so it must be a nice design ðŸ¤“

I've designed this project at first on [Figma](https://www.figma.com).

I've decided that which components will be when I designed on Figma,
_That was important._

And then,

I've created a react project via [Create-React-App](https://create-react-app.dev) 
and cleaned all of the unnecessary files and folders in the project.
I created a folder structure according to the component structure in the design. 

```
.  
â””â”€ src
    â”œâ”€â”€ assets
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ store
    â”œâ”€â”€ components
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ auth
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ common
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layout
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ page
    â”œâ”€â”€ constants
    â”œâ”€â”€ services
    â”œâ”€â”€ styles
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ auth
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ common
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layout
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ page
    â””â”€â”€ tests
        â”œâ”€â”€ component
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ page
        â””â”€â”€ service
```


And then,

I've created all components as primitive and I created a project layout structure also using [react-router](https://reactrouter.com) package.

**We've come to an exciting point. 
to write Test,**

I've written the test using the [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) approach.
I've written the content service layer test then write the service layer.
Also, I've used [Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io) for testing api communication.

Especially It was fun to code in the [Test Watching Mode](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli#--watchall) ðŸ˜Ž


You can run the test with the following code,

```shell
$ npm test
```

Finally, I've perfected the project design by writing CSS and using [Ant Design](https://ant.design)

## Q&A

### Why Ant Design?

Ant Design has a lot of components that have a nice design and easily customizable.
With these components, we can rapidly develop an enterprise-level application.

### Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?

Yes, if I have more time, I would make improvements to the following topics, 

- I would change the [react-scrips](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/updating-to-new-releases/) package to [react-app-wired](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired) because more flexible that injecting configs than react-scripts

Also I would spend time for,
- SEO optimization
- Responsive design 
- Server-side rendering
- Remove Ant Design
- Reduce load time 
- PWA 



_That's all,
Thank You._
